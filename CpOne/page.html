<h2>
    CHAPTER III &mdash; CONCERNING MIXED PRINCIPALITIES
</h2>
<p>
    But the difficulties occur in a new principality. And firstly, if it be
    not entirely new, but is, as it were, a member of a state which, taken
    collectively, may be called composite, the changes arise chiefly from an
    inherent difficulty which there is in all new principalities; for men
    change their rulers willingly, hoping to better themselves, and this hope
    induces them to take up arms against him who rules: wherein they are
    deceived, because they afterwards find by experience they have gone from
    bad to worse. This follows also on another natural and common necessity,
    which always causes a new prince to burden those who have submitted to him
    with his soldiery and with infinite other hardships which he must put upon
    his new acquisition.
</p>
<p>
    In this way you have enemies in all those whom you have injured in seizing
    that principality, and you are not able to keep those friends who put you
    there because of your not being able to satisfy them in the way they
    expected, and you cannot take strong measures against them, feeling bound
    to them. For, although one may be very strong in armed forces, yet in
    entering a province one has always need of the goodwill of the natives.
</p>
<p>
    For these reasons Louis the Twelfth, King of France, quickly occupied
    Milan, and as quickly lost it; and to turn him out the first time it only
    needed Lodovico's own forces; because those who had opened the gates to
    him, finding themselves deceived in their hopes of future benefit, would
    not endure the ill-treatment of the new prince. It is very true that,
    after acquiring rebellious provinces a second time, they are not so
    lightly lost afterwards, because the prince, with little reluctance, takes
    the opportunity of the rebellion to punish the delinquents, to clear out
    the suspects, and to strengthen himself in the weakest places. Thus to
    cause France to lose Milan the first time it was enough for the Duke
    Lodovico(*) to raise insurrections on the borders; but to cause him to
    lose it a second time it was necessary to bring the whole world against
    him, and that his armies should be defeated and driven out of Italy; which
    followed from the causes above mentioned.

     (*) Duke Lodovico was Lodovico Moro, a son of Francesco
     Sforza, who married Beatrice d'Este. He ruled over Milan
     from 1494 to 1500, and died in 1510.
